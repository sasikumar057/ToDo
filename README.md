# **To-Do List REST API**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a simple **To-Do List REST API** built using **Node.js** and **SQLite**. The API allows users to manage tasks effectively through **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. Each task consists of a title, description, and a status, which can be updated to track progress. The API stores task data in an **SQLite database** to persist the information across server restarts.

## **Features**
- **Create a task**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Fetch all tasks**: Retrieve a list of all tasks in the to-do list.
- **Fetch a task by ID**: Retrieve details of a specific task using its unique ID.
- **Update a task**: Change the status of a task (pending, in-progress, or completed).
- **Delete a task**: Remove a task from the list.
